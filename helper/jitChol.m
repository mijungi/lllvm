function [UC, jitter] = jitChol(A, maxTries)

% JITCHOL Do a Cholesky decomposition with jitter.
% FORMAT
% DESC attempts a Cholesky decomposition on the given matrix, if
% matrix isn't positive definite the function gives a warning, adds
% 'jitter' and tries again. At the first attempt the amount of
% jitter added is 1e-6 times the mean of the diagonal. Thereafter
% the amount of jitter is multiplied by 10 each time it is added
% again. This is continued for a maximum of 10 times.
% ARG A : the matrix for which the Cholesky decomposition is required.
% ARG maxTries : the maximum number of times that jitter is added
% before giving up (default 10).
% RETURN U : the Cholesky decomposition for the matrix.
