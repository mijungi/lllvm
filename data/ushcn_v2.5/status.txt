Note that all estimated values in the USHCN v2.5 dataset are identified
using the 'E' flag. As described in the previous versions of the readme.txt
file, NCDC's intent was to use a flagging system that 
distinguishes between estimates for values that were originally missing 
versus those that were removed as part of the homogenization process.  
NCDC intends to fix this issue in flag identification in the near future.

During the shutdown of government operations, USHCN version 2.5 will 
continue to update automatically (subject to the availability
of input data sources), but will not be monitored by the 
USHCN team.  We will also be unable to answer questions submitted 
to ncdc.ushcn@noaa.gov until after government operations resume.

An omission in the USHCN Time of Observation bias (TOB) correction process 
prevented the seasonally varying TOB adjustments from being applied 
to the USHCN version 2.5 "FLs.52i" temperature data.  This ommission
began on Oct. 22, 2012.  The ommission was rectified on February 12, 2013 
when the seasonally varying TOB adjustment resumed in the processing o
f the FLs.52i files.

Between October 22, 2012 and February 12, 2013, the Pairwise Homogeneization 
Algorithm (PHA) continued to function and provided an annual mean 
correction for the time of observation bias in the processing of 
the "FLs.52i" files.
